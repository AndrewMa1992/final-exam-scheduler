This directory contains all scripts to crawl section information from 
infocenter.rit.edu.

To crawl those information into a file readable by all FES programs:
./crawler.bash | php crawler.php > courses.txt

To create a database, use the db.sql script.

To crawl into a database:
./crawler.bash | php crawler.php | php upload.php <host> <user> <pass> <db>

Basically,
crawler.bash uses wget to dump content of all disciplines
crawler.php strip that content dump
upload.php uploads it to the db
